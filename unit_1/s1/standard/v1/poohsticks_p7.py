    Prompt:

    Winnie the Pooh and his friends are playing a game called Poohsticks
    where they drop sticks in a stream and race them. They time how long
    it takes each player's stick to float under Poohsticks Bridge to score
    each round.

    Write a function count_less_than() to help Pooh and his friends determine
    how many players should move on to the next round of Poohsticks 
    count_less_than() should accept a list of integers race_times and an
    integer threshold and return the number of race times less than threshold.
