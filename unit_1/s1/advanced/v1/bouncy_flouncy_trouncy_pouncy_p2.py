    Prompt:

    Tigger has developed a new programming language Tiger with only four operations and one
    variable tigger.

        * bouncy and flouncy both increment the value of the variable tigger by 1
        * trouncy and pouncy both decrement the value of the variable tigger by 1
    
    Initially, the value of tigger is 1 because he's the only tigger around! 

    Given a list of strings operations containing a list of operations, return the final
    value of tigger after performing all the operations
